Assignment #6

This is a page where you can search GIFs for your favorite wrestler. There are already pre-established buttons at the top of the page. Pressing any of the buttons will automatically get ten GIFs of the wrestler in a static state. Clicking on each GIF will start the animation and clicking on it again will freeze it back to the start.

You can search for any wrestler you like using the submittion form. Submitting a name will create a new button, which you can then click on to get ten GIFs of that wrestler. 

Below each GIF you will see the grading of the GIF as well as the name if has one. 

The site is also created to be fluid with various screen sizes.
